I am a junior PM and product researcher at [ClovaAI](https://clova.ai) üçÄ. I turn coffee into AI/ML products that are feasible and usable.

My research interests center around **human-AI interaction**. I am deeply interested in making AI interpretable and accessible, as well as promoting AI literacy. My research goal is to develop tools to help people better interact, utilize, and monitor the ML models. I employ a variety of methodologies and frameworks in my research, drawing on HCI and machine learning research.

I studied information science, economics and computer science at Seoul National University, where I graduated *[top of the class](/cv.html)* üèÖ. At SNU, I worked with [Professor Joonhwan Lee](https://hcid.snu.ac.kr) and [Professor Hwajung Hong](http://hwajunghong.com/).

In my free time, I love to read, play with my cat, and work on my media-arts projects.

I am applying for graduate programs this year. So if you are interested, please feel free to contact me via [eunjee.lynn.sung@gmail.com](mailto:eunjee.lynn.sung@gmail.com) :)
