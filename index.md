I am a first-year master's student at Stanford studying computer science. I turn coffee into AI/ML products that are feasible and usable.👩‍💻

My research interests center around **human-AI interaction** and **AI for creativity**. I am deeply interested in AI interpretable and accessible and helping people create things with AI. I like to develop tools to help people better interact, utilize, and monitor the ML models. I employ a variety of methodologies and frameworks in my research, drawing on HCI and machine learning research.

I studied information science, economics and computer science at Seoul National University, where I graduated *[top of the class](/cv.html)* 🏅. At SNU, I had the honor to work with [Professor Joonhwan Lee](https://hcid.snu.ac.kr) and [Professor Hwajung Hong](http://hwajunghong.com/).

In my free time, I love to read, play with my cat, and work on my arts projects.
